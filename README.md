# Gunn WATT

Gunn WATT (Web App of The Ttians) is a complete revamp of UGWA, the Unofficial Gunn Web App, complete with a backend, database, Schoology integration, and many more features.

WATT can be found live at [gunnwatt.web.app](https://gunnwatt.web.app).

### Project Structure
This project was built using ReactJS and Firebase, with a backend in Cloud Functions and database using Cloud Firestore.

The client (ReactJS) part of WATT is located in `/wattclient`, and the Cloud Functions are in `/functions`.


### Credits
[Yu-Ting](https://github.com/ytchang05) & [Kevin](https://github.com/ky28059) were the primary creators of WATT. Special thanks to [Ovinus Real](https://sheeptester.github.io) for advice and tips along the way.

Google Search and Stack Overflow helped greatly. Thanks to the Schoology API for integration with Schoology, as well as the libraries (and ReactJS and Firebase itself) that were used.

Many of the core features were inspired by [UGWA](https://github.com/Orbiit/gunn-web-app). Also thanks to those that helped in user testing and providing feedback.
