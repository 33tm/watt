# UGWA Backend

This project aspires to expand upon the original UGWA by adding in a framework and backend, similar to Homework Central.

### Folder Structure

The React.js portion of this app can be found in /ClientApp/src, and the (temporary) Express.js portion in /Backend.

In /ClientApp/src, react components can be located in /components. Components are sorted by the 5 app tabs they belong to (clubs, options, schedule, staff, and utilities).
