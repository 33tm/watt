The core \r\nstructure of all the modules – the assignment Template – progresses along an “arc” from reading rhetorically \r\n(preparing to read, reading purposefully, and questioning the text) to preparing to respond (discovering what you \r\nthink) to writing rhetorically (composing a draft, revising rhetorically, and editing).",

Drawing well is the foundation for painting well, thus it is after drawing that advanced color theory, \r\npainting approaches and brush techniques are considered through acrylic, watercolor and digital painting. \r\nAssignments are designed to build the “artist’s tool belt”– the technical and expressive skills to render a broad range \r\nof surface qualities or textures upon the illusion of forms, in both black and white and color. The lessons encourage \r\ncreative, imaginative thinking to begin visually communicating personal concepts. \r\nHistorical and cross-cultural views on art are integrated into lessons and discussions; sketchbooks are highly used; and \r\nexposure to local artwork is obligatory. Representatives will be invited to present, from private Art Colleges and UCs \r\nwith strong art programs, about options for art careers. \r\nCourse work will include art history, research, museum reports, artist statements, and participation in critiques.",

Students can choose to focus their \r\nportfolio specifically towards Photography or Graphic Design or Painting and Drawing. \r\nStudents who enroll in this college-level course must first successfully complete a review of their current portfolio with \r\nthe 2-D Studio Art instructor for assessment, ideally by the end of the previous year. If the quantity and quality in the \r\nbody of work reflects the necessary preparation, or summer plans indicate productive art making or instruction, then \r\nthere is acceptance to proceed. \r\nApproximately 15 completed pieces reflecting first-year, college-level standards are required in the portfolio by the \r\nfirst week of May, and should exhibit these areas of concern: Selected Works and Sustained Investigation. Five actual \r\npieces for the Selected Works portion are mailed in an 18’ X24” portfolio to the AP College Board, and will be returned \r\nby mid-summer. \r\nQuarterly, one-on-one reviews are scheduled with the instructor to monitor progress, guide the artistic process and \r\nevaluate conceptual development and mastery of the chosen discipline. To maintain a position in this course, evidence \r\nof progress per quarter is upheld with a commitment to responsible studio behavior is expected. The AP College Board \r\nwill assign college credit for this course after their review, upon receiving a score of 3 or higher and completion of their \r\nform.

Students develop proficiencies across the full range of communication modes (interpersonal, presentational, \r\nand interpretive), thereby honing their critical reading and analytical writing skills. Literature is examined within the \r\ncontext of its time and place, as students reflect on the many voices and cultures present in the required readings. The \r\ncourse also includes a strong focus on cultural connections and comparisons, including exploration of various media \r\n(e.g. art, film, literary criticism).",

There is also a large collaborative component of the course, as students \r\nwork in teams to present their findings. Similar to a \"First-Year\" seminar experience in college, students will engage in \r\ncross-curricular conversations that explore the complexities of academic and real-world topics and issues by analyzing \r\ndivergent perspectives (scientific, economic, political, cultural). Students should be strong readers of non-fiction \r\nprimary texts, fluent writers and team players.",

Increase the positive school culture through academic and social events. \r\n2.
