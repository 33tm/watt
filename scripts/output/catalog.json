The curriculum is designed to fit the needs of both four-year-college-bound \nstudents and those interested in a two-year career tech education. Conceptual instruction begins with the design cycle, \nwhich students experience in all stages, including hands-on skill development from brainstorming to prototyping to \nmanufacturing and testing. Mechanism design and prototyping, programming, electronics, pneumatics, machining \nand welding, and CAD (computer-aided design) technologies are introduced to all students using industry-standard \nequipment. Applications of scientific and engineering principles, group dynamics, leadership and communication \nskills are developed in an activity-oriented approach including informal classroom challenges and two or more FIRST \nRobotics competitions each year. \nStudents who wish to enroll in Engineering Technology must select this course as an Alternate since members will be \nselected as members of the Gunn Robotics Team (GRT). Team members will be selected based on team needs of skills. \nAn application process will be used to award spaces within GRT, and detailed information regarding this process will \nbe published in January. Students who have completed Introduction to Engineering Design, Principles of Engineering \nand Robotics, an Automotive Technology course, or a Stage Technology course will be given special consideration \nduring the selection process.",

Continuation in the course for a second semester may be requested by the student and \nmay granted by the instructor at the teacher’s discretion. \nEligibility\trequirements\tare: (1) The student must have completed and passed 9th grade PE and be a 10th, 11th \nor 12th grader, (2) the student must have met 5 of 6 fitness standards during 9th grade PE as determined by California \nFitness test, (3) the sport/activity is not offered at Gunn, (4) the activity will occur under the supervision of a \nSupervising Instructor/Coach who has the appropriate training and expertise to provide the level of instruction \nrequired for the activity, (5) the student has a minimum of three years’ prior experience in the activity. Qualifying \nexperience is year-round instruction/training on a 5-6 days per week average, 6) The activity involves skill \nimprovement sessions 5-6 days per week, Student practices/trains a minimum of 15 hours per week under appropriate \nsupervision of a qualified Instructor/Coach. \nThe application Packet with pages 1-3, 6 and 7 must be returned along with evidence to the Physical Education \nInstructional Supervisor, before the second Friday of each semester to be eligible. \nFurther information and the instructional packet can be found on our Gunn Physical Education website.",

Drawing well is the foundation for painting well, thus it is after drawing that advanced color theory, \npainting approaches and brush techniques are considered through acrylic, watercolor and digital painting. \nAssignments are designed to build the “artist’s tool belt”– the technical and expressive skills to render a broad range \nof surface qualities or textures upon the illusion of forms, in both black and white and color. The lessons encourage \ncreative, imaginative thinking to begin visually communicating personal concepts. \nHistorical and cross-cultural views on art are integrated into lessons and discussions; sketchbooks are highly used; and \nexposure to local artwork is obligatory.

Students will synthesize and articulate research on any number of subjects into formally presented \narguments, both written, multi-media, and oral. There is also a large collaborative component of the course, as students \nwork in teams to present their findings. Similar to a \"First-Year\" seminar experience in college, students will engage in \ncross-curricular conversations that explore the complexities of academic and real-world topics and issues by analyzing \ndivergent perspectives (scientific, economic, political, cultural). Students should be strong readers of non-fiction \nprimary texts, fluent writers and team players.",
