/**
 * This JS file allows for migration from previous staff JSON files.
 * Essentially, keeps the keys of staff the same whilst also scraping
 * the new staff list from Gunn's website and ParentSquare.
 *
 * This file must first match up teachers from Gunn's website and 
 * from ParentSquare. (They both contain necessary information, so
 * we actually have to use both.)
 * 
 * This process is a pain, especially because the only field that
 * really corroborates between the two is their name. This program
 * uses Ratcliff-Obershelp similarity combined with other tricks
 * (see nameSimilarity) to detect name similarity. I believe it to 
 * be decently accurate for this application.
 * 
 * Then, once merged, we must match the new information to the old keys
 * in the previous staff.json, given their name and other info. This is 
 * because keys must (ideally) stay constant throughout JSON regens.
 *
 * ----------
 *
 * This program requires
 *      * the previous staff.json to be put in folder ../input/
 *
 * This program outputs
 *      * the new staff.json in ../output/staff.json
 *
 * -----------
 * Known problems / To do:
 *      * This program does not validate any of the information.
 *          This sometimes causes weird thingsâ„¢ to happen due to human error
 *          on Gunn's website, such as having a phone extension be
 *          "Stud Tchr" or having no phone number at all.
