Since the course was designed to mesh with The Expository Reading and Writing Course, the majority of our reading will be non-fiction texts drawn from a variety of disciplines. We also explore  contemporary  plays  about  global  issues,  make  space  for  free  reading  assignments,  and  include  a  creative writing  unit  in  which  students  convey  their  learning  across  the  disciplines  through  narrative.  We  do  most  of  our reading  outside  of  class,  with  a  focus  on  developing  strategies  to  help  students  understand  even  the  most  difficult content and text structures. During class meetings we have lively discussions, play-reading time, and instruction in argumentative  writing.  By  the  end  of  the  course,  students will  read  more  widely,  more  skillfully,  and  with  more enjoyment than before. \n• Homework  Expectation:  4  hours  a  week,  with  3  of  those  hours  dedicated  to    outside  of  class  reading  time.

The  course includes five to six full-length modules drawn from three categories:  1) Shakespeare drama; 2) full-length books; and 3) contemporary issues (three to four modules). In addition, the course includes two short portfolio modules and at least three mini-modules that address transferable skills applicable to conceptual development and practice across all modules,  e.g.,  genre  awareness,  goal  setting  and  self-assessment,  rhetorical  situation,  Aristotelian  appeals.  The  core structure  of  all  the  modules – the  assignment  Template – progresses  along an  “arc”  from  reading  rhetorically (preparing  to  read,  reading  purposefully,  and  questioning  the  text)  to  preparing  to  respond  (discovering what  you think) to writing rhetorically (composing a draft, revising rhetorically, and editing).  \n• Homework Expectation:  2 hours a week, with 1 of those hours dedicated to reading \n• District SLOs Addressed in this Course:  1, 2, 5, 6 \n• This is a college prep course "

Freshmen are not eligible – this is to ensure that all students are exposed to a well-rounded Physical Education curriculum and participate in a series of state-mandated physical performance tests later in ninth grade. This program allows up to one of those years to be taken  as  Independent Study  for  students  participating  in  sports  not  offered  at  PAUSD  high  schools.  Permission  is granted one semester at a time. Continuation in the course for a second semester may be requested by the student and may granted by the instructor at the teacher’s discretion. Eligibility\trequirements\tare: (1) The student must have completed and passed 9th grade PE and be a 10th, 11th or 12th grader, (2) the student must have met 5 of 6 fitness standards during 9th grade PE as determined by California Fitness  test, (3)  the  sport/activity  is  not  offered  at  Gunn,  (4)  the  activity  will  occur  under  the  supervision  of  a Supervising  Instructor/Coach  who  has  the  appropriate  training  and  expertise  to  provide  the  level  of  instruction required  for  the  activity,  (5)  the  student has  a  minimum  of  three  years’ prior  experience  in  the  activity.  Qualifying experience  is  year-round  instruction/training  on  a  5-6  days  per  week  average,  6)  The  activity  involves  skill improvement sessions 5-6 days per week, Student practices/trains a minimum of 15 hours per week under appropriate supervision of a qualified Instructor/Coach. The  application  Packet  with  pages  1-3,  6  and  7  must  be  returned  along  with  evidence  to  the  Physical  Education Instructional Supervisor, before the second Friday of each semester to be eligible.

Through 2-D and 3-D experiences the curriculum will provide each artist with the ability to generate creative ideas as well as the skills to execute them. Since learning to create visual art involves learning to see, Art Spectrum focuses on the development of this essential visual skill. Observational and conceptual exercises will explore the use of a broad variety  of  materials,  techniques,  and  treatments  used  to  design,  draw,  paint,  and  sculpt.  Approaching  the  arts  with traditional, hands-on methods, students will learn how to render from life using graphite or charcoal, paint knowing color theory using tempera or watercolor, design with elements and principles using software or apps, and build three-dimensional forms using clay or wire.  Exposure to art in our community, peer support, and the development of personal sketchbooks will build confidence to  create.  This  course  inspires  and  encourages  a  positive  feeling  about  the  visual  arts,  and  knowledge  of  the  basic techniques and procedures to experience and understand art.

Drawing  well  is  the  foundation  for  painting  well,  thus  it  is  after  drawing  that  advanced  color  theory, painting approaches and brush techniques are considered through acrylic, watercolor and digital painting. Assignments are designed to build the “artist’s tool belt”– the technical and expressive skills to render a broad range of surface qualities or textures upon the illusion of forms, in both black and white and color. The lessons encourage creative, imaginative thinking to begin visually communicating personal concepts. Historical and cross-cultural views on art are integrated into lessons and discussions; sketchbooks are highly used; and exposure to local artwork is obligatory. Representatives will be invited to present, from private Art Colleges and UCs with strong art programs, about options for art careers.
