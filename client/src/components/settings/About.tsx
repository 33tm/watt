                WATT was jointly created by <a href="https://github.com/ky28059" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kevin</a>, who made the frontend,
                and <a href="https://github.com/ytchang05" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Yu-Ting</a>, who originally wrote the backend.{' '}
                <a href="https://github.com/ImNotRog" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Roger</a> helped immensely with Schoology integration,
                as well as maintaining the backend and scripts.
                Special thanks to <a href="https://github.com/mymylie" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mylie</a> who designed our lovely logo.
            </p>

            <p className="mb-4">
                Thank you to all of our GitHub contributors, who dedicated their time and expertise to work on
                this project.

                Finally, this app would not have been possible without its predecessor, <a href="https://github.com/Orbiit/gunn-web-app" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">UGWA</a>.
                A large thank you to <a href="https://github.com/SheepTester" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sean</a>,
                for not just his mentorship and guidance but for inspiring the new generation of Gunn creators to reach
                for the stars. It is our hope that WATT can take up this mantle, fostering interest in programming for
                years to come.
